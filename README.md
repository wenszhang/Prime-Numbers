# Prime-Numbers

Prime numbers. Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and then prints out all prime numbers up to that integer.

For example, when the user enters 20, the program should print 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

Recall that a number is a prime number if it is not divisible by any number except 1 and itself.

Use a class PrimeGenerator with methods nextPrime and isPrime. Supply a class PrimePrinter whose main method reads a user input, constructs a Prime Generator object, and prints the primes.

 

Include IPO, UML, flowchart, javadoc, and junit test
